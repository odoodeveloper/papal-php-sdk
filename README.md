# papal-php-sdk
Paypal PHP Integration Script

composer is the recommended way to install the SDK. Alternatively, if you prefer not to use Composer, but want to install our SDK, you can do so by doing a direct download

Currently, Paypal PHP Rest API SDK is available at https://packagist.org. To use it in your project, you need to include it as a dependency in your project composer.json file.
Instructions

    Download Composer if not already installed

    Go to your project directory. If you do not have one, just create a directory and cd in.

    mkdir project
    cd project

    Execute composer require "paypal/rest-api-sdk-php:*" on command line. Replace composer with composer.phar if required. It should show something like this:

    > composer require "paypal/rest-api-sdk-php:*"

    ./composer.json has been created
    Loading composer repositories with package information
    Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
    - Installing paypal/rest-api-sdk-php (v0.16.1)
    Loading from cache

    Writing lock file
    Generating autoload files

    This is how your directory structure would look like. That's it. You have PayPal PHP SDK installed.
